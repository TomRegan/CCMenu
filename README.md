# CCMenu

This is not, for the majority, my work. Please see COPYING for

## What's all this in aid of?

I found using the CCMenu app pretty egregious on the whole.
The preferences selection boxes were too small, and the
project list it showed you was a shambles. I've simply altered
the size of the list panes, and sorted the project list.
