# CCMenu

CCMenu was originally developed by Thoughtworks. Please see COPYING for
more info.

## What does this do?

CCMenu allows you to monitor cctray xml feeds, the likes of
which are popped out of CI servers such as Jenkins and Go.

This is exactly the sort of thing you might like to do if you
are interested in the status of builds.

## What is happening?

As I see it, I'm making some improvements. You're entitled
to your own opinion.

## Why is this happening?

Using the CCMenu app was pretty egregious on the whole.
The preferences selection boxes were too small, and the
project list it showed you was a shambles. I've simply altered
the size of the list panes, and sorted the project list.

## Improvements

## Future Stuff

Any, all, or maybe none of the following

- An organised project menu
- Fixes for performance issues
- A build (courtesy of [elmundio87](https://github.com/elmundio87))
- A configurable update mechanism
